                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In past times, conflicts over land, food, wealth, religious and beliefs were common. Our ancestors from thousands of years ago used to fight for these type of things, but, these were our ancestors, they weren’t as developed and certainly did not have a similar knowledge to us. Over time, these conflicts on food and water diminished, as countries produced their own agriculture and had fresh water sources for their citizens, conflicts over these essential items greatly decreased. In recent times however, these water sources have been used for industrial uses such as electricity generation, chemical products and production of goods. The use of these water sources diminish the amount of available water for residents and citizens who depend on it, the most common one, the Nile. This use of water in the 21st century will bring and has already brought with it increasing conflicts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A river known all over the world, the Nile. It spans over 11 countries and contains over 10% of Africa’s landmass. It is estimated that over 280 million people rely on water coming from the Nile. These reasons span from using it as drinking water to using it to clean clothes and take showers. Recently, Ethiopia has introduced the idea to build a dam into it’s part of the Nile river and use it as a cleaner way to generate electricity. For some, this might seem as an ingenious idea, but it has gotten people in Egypt worried. Egypt built a dam in 1971 named the Aswan High Dam, there were no great consequences, but as time went on, Egypt’s green ecosystem that spans 161 km has been in a gradual decline. The Aswan High interrupted important natural cycles such as flooding. Flooding enriched the arable land in Egypt making it fertile for agriculture, but since the flow of water is slowed down by the dam, flooding is either non-existent or very rare, effectively turning this once fertile land for agriculture into an eroded and forgotten in-fertile land. If Ethiopia go through with building a dam, the flow of water will slow down even more, scientist’s predicted worst and best case scenarios. If Ethiopia decides to fill the dam within 3 years, it is expected that Egypt could lose 50% of its share of water and 67% of the agricultural area will be destroyed and switched out with infertile land. The best case scenario, if Ethiopia fills up their dam in 21 years, it is expected Egypt will lose 5% of their water share and around 2.5% of their agricultural area. No matter how long Ethiopia decides how long they want to fill up their dam, Egypt will be the one to suffer the consequences. The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), is an intergovernmental partnerships between most countries that rely on the Nile. Though recently, political tensions between Egypt and Sudan have been rising against Ethiopia, even to the extent of including threat of military action should Ethiopia end up interfering with the Nile’s flow as agreements signed in 1929 and 1959, Anwar el-Sadat, Egypt’s president in the 1980 went as far to say “If ethiopia takes any action to block our right to the Nile waters, there will be no alternative for us but to use force”. Now, this is just one example of a river that spans multiple countries, there are issues similar to this with the MeKong and the ganges.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Over the last hundred years, the amount of global water conflicts have quadrupled. The U.S National Institute of Health has recorded that 83 global water conflicts were present between 1990 and 2007, that’s almost 4 times what they saw between 1900-1959 where the total number of global water conflicts was just only 22. The NIH also reported a 4 times increase in conflict per year and a 3 times (went from 19 to 61) increase in the number of violent conflicts over water. The NIH has deemed that this is “a problem that will likely increase as the world population grows from 6.8 billion to 9.0 billion by 2050”. The NIH has now proven that water scarcity has already brought increasing global conflicts over water, that more of these conflicts are now being violent and that the overall average of global water conflicts per year has grown tremendously and will keep rising until countries band together to fix the problem.</span></p><p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the United Nations and NATO have published documents on water usages and scarcity around the world. The United Nations has been working closely with countries involved to donate and fund clean drinking water to places that do not have access to it. There are many ways of reducing water scarcity, such as reducing the use of water, and reducing industrial pollution and sewage contamination of water. These all seem like great ideas, but, the UN, NATO and NIH all warn that none will be successful unless a proactive cooperation between countries and governments is started. Some of these already exist, such as the Good Water neighbors project and the Nile Basin initiative, but these are not enough. The world needs most countries brought together into one project, the US, France, UK, Russia, everyone. Water scarcity is such a huge problem that governments will need new laws, regulating industrial uses, the amount rich corporations are allowed to use, making it more expensive for higher income people to get water (balance the use, if it’s more expensive they’ll use less), and this would be a viable idea if it weren’t for political adversaries, political beliefs and conflicts between countries. Some Politicians do not believe in these water conflicts and the right to water. In 2019, President Trump tried starting a withdrawal from NATO before being stopped by congress, even before that, in 2018 Trump withdrew the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Council which included topics of climate change and water scarcity. The president has also brought with him conflicts with other countries. The President has also favored businesses when appointing new laws and rules, meaning that a limit on industrial pollution and water usages, or a proactive cooperation between world leaders is unlikely to be seen.
<br>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nile, the NIH, United Nations, and Nato have all warned that water scarcity is now, not in 10 or 20 years, these conflicts have started, and are all increasing unless something is done about it. The question whether if water scarcity will bring increasing conflicts in the 21st century isn’t a question, it’s a fact. Water scarcity has already brought with it increasing conflicts. Countries, governments and intergovernmental agencies should be asking themselves what they are going to do about it, because, that is the only way things will change, if people, governments and countries band together in one, water scarcity and conflicts can be brought to a minimal, ensuring human rights to food, water, environmental and economic stability.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p>
