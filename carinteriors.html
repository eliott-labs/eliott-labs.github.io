                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touchscreen here, touchscreen there, a touchscreen everywhere. When stepping into most electric vehicles all you can seem to notice is the sheer amount of screen space and lack of any physical controls. Nowadays, as the volume knob becomes more and more absent from car interiors the volume dial on the Mustang Mach-E is seen as a feature rather than a given. Some manufacturers have been reluctant to make the switch to fully electric controls, whilst others have embraced it and made it part of the whole vehicle. So, what’s with this trend? And which big automakers aren’t so convinced by the fully digital ecosystem?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I should mention, most cars now have a touchscreen, although, they still come with physical controls for the screen such as a control dial and usually have physical controls for AC, Volume etc.… What I’m talking about is the trend to fully touchscreen, no dials and no physical controls.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explore the invasion of touchscreens in our world, we should go back to where it all started, in 2007 when Apple released the first fully usable touchscreen device; I’m aware devices similar were available but touchscreen devices weren’t as user friendly or easy to use until Apple innovated it. Ever since then, it has been a road of touchscreen upon touchscreen. To return to the Automotive part of this, the first in-car Touchscreen was not a Tesla and was in fact the Buick Rivera, released in 1986. A 9 inch display which house volume and AC controls, sound familiar right? In fact BMW also tried this in 2002, with a Touchscreen I-Drive system in the 7-Series, but similarly to touchscreen phones/laptops, it wasn’t until Tesla revolutionized the in-car touchscreen in 2012 with the release of the Tesla Model S. that it really took off. Since then, car interiors have become much simpler, with less complexity and auxiliary controls.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently released cars such as the Rivian R1T, Mini ACEMAN and the BMW IX are examples of cars with fully digital experience with no visible buttons or dials. It’s not as bad in some vehicles as it is in others though. Some manufacturers have understood that scrolling through 5 different menus just to get AC Control while driving isn’t the best idea. So what was their response? Add more screens. That’s right, the Audi E-Tron for instance, has added a separate screen dedicated to the AC System. 
<br>Obviously experiences and opinions differ on this topic, but I can say that even after years of being in the same vehicle, I still don’t understand some of the menus or settings. And that’s in a car that only has a display for GPS, Car play and the rest has buttons. For as much as they tell us not to text and drive, imagine trying to figure out how to do something on the touchscreen while driving down a busy highway and you pretty much get the same result.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, while doing research for this Journal, Vibiligare- A Swedish automotive magazine published results of an experiment they did on this exact topic. 
<br>	The driver had to fulfill 4 tasks in 12 different cars. Some with full touchscreens, some with buttons and dials etc. They timed how long it took for the driver to perform these 4 tasks while driving at 110 km/h. The tasks were as follows:</p><p>•	Activate the heated seat, increase temperature by two degrees, and start the defroster.
<br>•	Power on the radio and adjust the station to a specific channel (Sweden’s Program 1).
<br>•	Reset the trip computer.
<br>•	Lower the instrument lighting to the lowest level and turn off the center display.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want full details on the results, feel free to go read their article <a href="https://www.vibilagare.se/nyheter/physical-buttons-outperform-touchscreens-new-cars-test-finds" class="text-primary" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br>The quick summary was that on average, cars with digital controls (which I considered to be touchscreen vehicles with no dials or buttons) took 23 seconds while cars with buttons dials &amp; touchscreen took an average of 17 seconds. That’s a whole 6 second average difference where you’re not paying attention. To make this worse, the best score was from the Volvo V70 who only took 10 seconds to complete these tasks. This car was produced in 2005 and had only buttons and dials.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their experiment also included findings that some cars made drivers have to look down more meaning they lost more visibility of the road. Here below you can find the big differences in their findings:
<br>•	The easiest car to understand and operate, by a large margin, is the 2005 Volvo V70. The four tasks are handled within ten seconds flat, during which the car is driven 306 meters at 110 km/h.
<br>•	At the other end of the scale, Chinese electric car MG Marvel R performs far worse. The driver needs 44.6 seconds before all the tasks are completed, during which the car has travelled 1,372 meters – more than four times the distance compared to the old Volvo.
<br>•	BMW iX and Seat Leon perform better, but both are still too complicated. The driver needs almost a kilometer to perform the tasks. Lots can happen in traffic during that time.
<br>•	Dacia Sandero and Volvo C40 perform well although they both have touchscreens. However, they are not overloaded with features. Volvo shows that a touchscreen doesn’t need to be complicated.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Car manufacturers around the world now need to be asking themselves a question. Digital Car interiors are better for what? Design or Productivity. This Journal isn’t to say screens are bad and we should keep analog controls, this journal is simply to say that if controls are turning digital, they must be done in the right way which helps the driver instead of hindering them.
