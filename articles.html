                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen as one of the most exciting electric car companies to hit the market in recent years, Rivian Automotive has a mission to dominate the Electric truck and SUV market with their innovative and stunning looking cars. Although their future looks bright, with a strong initial performance on NASDAQ, Rivians  industry is saturated with similar competitors, plagued with supply chain issues and a two-faced Amazon investment. They have a long road to success, with Elon Musk showcasing his support by saying “I hope they’re able to achieve high production and breakeven cash flow”.
<br></p><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2018, Rivian announced their flagship models, the R1S and the R1T. Initially with a strong consumer reaction, Rivian racked up a comfortable 71,000 pre-orders. One of Rivian’s strength is the breathtaking design of their R1T pickup truck and the hype that surrounds their cars. If apple made a pickup truck, this is what I’d imagine it would look like. Engineers at Rivian have been able to make a skateboard style platform for their cars, where the body can just be placed on top, making a fluid modular design, bringing down the costs of designing frames for futures car models. 
<br></p><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the excitement Rivian has been associated with, huge players in the automotive industry have noticed the huge potential of the E.V Maker, this prompted monster car manufacturer Ford to invest 1.2 Billion USD into the project and now own a 12% stake in the company valued at around 10 Billion USD, an 8.2 Billion growth since their initial investment. Along with Fords investment, Amazon threw 1.3 Billion USD at Rivian in exchange for an estimated 20% stake and commitments from Rivian in making electric delivery trucks. One of the most difficult things for automotive startups is gaining the capital and money necessary to be able to succeed, through the investments made from Ford, Amazon and others, Rivian have put themselves in a prime position financially to be able to continue their project. 
<br>	</p><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although to many, Amazon’s investment may seem like a fantastic opportunity for Rivian, some analysts have seen the investment as a double edged sword. Part of Amazon’s investment in Rivian, was that in return, they produced 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2030. This is seen as a positive and a negative, as it brings Rivian business and cash-flow, it also prevents them from being able to focus solely on their consumer road vehicles, and depletes their already strapped production capabilities. 
<br></p><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An issue which has plagues electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla is production. With Rivian, the story stays the same, unlike Tesla, Rivian is newer and doesn’t have the same infrastructure as the other automotive giants. By the end of 2021, only 1,015 Rivian vehicles had been manufactured and 920 had been delivered to customers, now looking at the numbers of Amazon delivery trucks, Rivian states it is on track to complete 10,000 by 2022. This gauges an accurate view on how their resources have been split between Amazon commitments and consumer vehicles. Continuing, Rivian have been forced to delay delivery dates, with vehicles intended to be delivered in June 2021, delayed until early 2022, and their extended battery vehicles delayed until 2023. Rivian has announced plans for another production plant in Georgia, which should be able to produce 400,000 vehicles per year in 2024. 
<br></p><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rivian launched on the NASDAQ in November 2021 and had a strong intial showing, since then, it has a seen a 67% decrease over time. This is due to the paired duo of supply chain issues which continue to hamper them, and now the Ukraine – Russia conflict. Rivian reported a fourth quarter revenue of 54$ Million, below the estimate of 64$ Million by analysts. Many experts in the stock market classify Rivian as a bubble, it’s evaluation on the stock market has been over-valued and thus has lead to a crash, similar to the housing crisis in 2007. With many experts expecting an imminent market crash in the near future, Rivian represents a bubble ready to burst, as a highly valued company, with low cash flow and production capabilities, many now expect the U.S based electric vehicle maker to fall under in the near future. 
<br></p><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many opportunities in the electric vehicle market were slowed by the pandemic, but opportunities are no re-opening. Mainly, the European markets are becoming prime targets for the future of E.V’s. With the U.K banning sale of new gas &amp; diesel cars by 2030, Europe is a huge vehicle market (18% of sales every year) with a huge electric vehicle market gap that needs filling. So far, Tesla has not been able to conquer Europe like it has the US and European automakers are now deciding to take the opportunity themselves. In October 2021, Rivian announced plans to start selling vehicles in Europe in the near future, with the Netherlands and the U.K enticing Rivian to open manufacturing plants in their countries, Boris Johnson was quoted as offering Rivian a “bespoke incentives package” to lure Rivian into the English car market.
<br>Another opportunity not yet announced by Rivian, is entering the Extreme E competition. Initially started in 2021, Extreme E is an extreme offroad racing event using electric vehicles, with many famous ex-racers starting teams, such as; Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg, Lewis Hamilton and even the Andretti family, it is no surprise that this sport is seen as a future blockbuster. If Rivian could become a Title Sponsor/ Team, it could promote their electric vehicles on track and lead to consumer vehicle sales, similar to Mercedes F1, Scuderia Ferrari, Aston Martin Racing ect..
<br></p><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with any other electric vehicle maker, Rivian faces many threats to their business, including the rising number of competitors. Looking at the electric vehicle market now, new companies such as Nio, Lucid Motors and even legacy auto-makers like Volkswagen, BMW and Audi are now getting involved. For Rivian, these all represent a threat to their potential audience and target market. It is a race against time to see who can offer the best package, for the best price and with the fastest delivery. Most automotive companies now offer at least 1 electric car with many having announced more, Ford has now launched the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and others… 
<br></p><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with many other companies, the current rising prices of chips and silicon-wafers impacts the abilities of Rivian. As many electrical components and services use these products, especially in an electric car, Rivian had to raise their base price 17% to 79,500$. This was met with backlash from consumers, but it is understandable, that for a small company, it is not in a place to be able to take losses left and right in the current time.
<br>In Conclusion, Rivian is a very exciting and promising electric vehicle maker, but it has been met with many big challenges, it has succeeded so far, but nobody knows what the future holds. They hold a strong hand in this current market, with lots of opportunities for the future, Electric Vehicle manufacturers are racing against each other for the time being and currently, Tesla is winning.
